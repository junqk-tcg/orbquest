# Orb Quest

A minimalist maze game that combines classic arcade-style gameplay with modern design principles. Navigate through increasingly challenging levels, racing against time and testing your spatial awareness.

## Design Philosophy

Orb Quest embraces a clean, minimalist aesthetic that puts gameplay first. The design choices reflect this philosophy:

- **Visual Clarity**: High contrast between game elements ensures clear visibility and immediate understanding of the game state
- **Intuitive Controls**: Simple arrow key movement creates an accessible yet engaging experience
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each level introduces new challenges while maintaining the core gameplay loop
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and interactive feedback helps players understand their actions and progress
